Results included in this manuscript come from preprocessing
performed using *fMRIPrep* 25.2.5
(@fmriprep1; @fmriprep2; RRID:SCR_016216),
which is based on *Nipype* 1.10.0
(@nipype1; @nipype2; RRID:SCR_002502).



Preprocessing of B<sub>0</sub> inhomogeneity mappings

: A total of 1 fieldmaps were found available within the input
BIDS structure for this particular subject.
A *B<sub>0</sub>* nonuniformity map (or *fieldmap*) was estimated from the
phase-drift map(s) measure with two consecutive GRE (gradient-recalled echo)
acquisitions.
The corresponding phase-map(s) were phase-unwrapped with `prelude` (FSL None).

Anatomical data preprocessing

: A total of 1 T1-weighted (T1w) images were found within the input
BIDS dataset. The T1w image was corrected for intensity
non-uniformity (INU) with `N4BiasFieldCorrection` [@n4], distributed with ANTs 2.6.2
[@ants, RRID:SCR_004757], and used as T1w-reference throughout the workflow.
The T1w-reference was then skull-stripped with a *Nipype* implementation of
the `antsBrainExtraction.sh` workflow (from ANTs), using OASIS30ANTs
as target template.
Brain tissue segmentation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF),
white-matter (WM) and gray-matter (GM) was performed on
the brain-extracted T1w using `fast` [FSL (version unknown), RRID:SCR_002823, @fsl_fast].
Volume-based spatial normalization to two standard spaces (MNI152NLin6Asym, MNI152NLin2009cAsym) was performed through
nonlinear registration with `antsRegistration` (ANTs 2.6.2),
using brain-extracted versions of both T1w reference and the T1w template.
The following templates were were selected for spatial normalization
and accessed with *TemplateFlow* [25.0.4, @templateflow]:
*FSL's MNI ICBM 152 non-linear 6th Generation Asymmetric Average Brain Stereotaxic Registration Model* [@mni152nlin6asym, RRID:SCR_002823; TemplateFlow ID: MNI152NLin6Asym], *ICBM 152 Nonlinear Asymmetrical template version 2009c* [@mni152nlin2009casym, RRID:SCR_008796; TemplateFlow ID: MNI152NLin2009cAsym].

Functional data preprocessing

: For each of the 7 BOLD runs found per subject (across all
tasks and sessions), the following preprocessing was performed.
First, a reference volume was generated from the shortest echo of the BOLD run,
using a custom methodology of *fMRIPrep*, for use in head motion correction.
Head-motion parameters with respect to the BOLD reference
(transformation matrices, and six corresponding rotation and translation
parameters) are estimated before any spatiotemporal filtering using
`mcflirt` [FSL <ver>, @mcflirt].
The estimated *fieldmap* was then aligned with rigid-registration to the target
EPI (echo-planar imaging) reference run.
The field coefficients were mapped on to the reference EPI using the transform.
The BOLD reference was then co-registered to the T1w reference using
`mri_coreg` (FreeSurfer) followed by `flirt` [FSL <ver>, @flirt]
with the boundary-based registration [@bbr] cost-function.
Co-registration was configured with six degrees of freedom.
BOLD runs were slice-time corrected to 0.75s (0.5 of slice acquisition range
0s-1.5s) using `3dTshift` from AFNI  [@afni, RRID:SCR_005927].
A T2<sup>★</sup> map was estimated from the preprocessed EPI echoes using tedana's t2smap
workflow [@DuPre2021], by voxel-wise fitting the maximal number of echoes with reliable signal in
that voxel to a monoexponential signal decay model with nonlinear regression. The T2<sup>★</sup>/S<sub>0</sub> estimates from a log-linear regression fit were used for initial values.
The calculated T2<sup>★</sup> map was then used to optimally combine preprocessed BOLD across
echoes following the method described in [@posse_t2s].
The optimally combined time series was carried forward as the *preprocessed BOLD*.
Several confounding time-series were calculated based on the
*preprocessed BOLD*: framewise displacement (FD), DVARS and
three region-wise global signals.
FD was computed using two formulations following Power (absolute sum of
relative motions, @power_fd_dvars) and Jenkinson (relative root mean square
displacement between affines, @mcflirt).
FD and DVARS are calculated for each functional run, both using their
implementations in *Nipype* [following the definitions by @power_fd_dvars].
The three global signals are extracted within the CSF, the WM, and
the whole-brain masks.
Additionally, a set of physiological regressors were extracted to
allow for component-based noise correction [*CompCor*, @compcor].
Principal components are estimated after high-pass filtering the
*preprocessed BOLD* time-series (using a discrete cosine filter with
128s cut-off) for the two *CompCor* variants: temporal (tCompCor)
and anatomical (aCompCor).
tCompCor components are then calculated from the top 2% variable
voxels within the brain mask.
For aCompCor, three probabilistic masks (CSF, WM and combined CSF+WM)
are generated in anatomical space.
The implementation differs from that of Behzadi et al. in that instead
of eroding the masks by 2 pixels on BOLD space, a mask of pixels that
likely contain a volume fraction of GM is subtracted from the aCompCor masks.
This mask is obtained by thresholding the corresponding partial volume map at 0.05, and it ensures components are not extracted
from voxels containing a minimal fraction of GM.
Finally, these masks are resampled into BOLD space and binarized by
thresholding at 0.99 (as in the original implementation).
Components are also calculated separately within the WM and CSF masks.
For each CompCor decomposition, the *k* components with the largest singular
values are retained, such that the retained components' time series are
sufficient to explain 50 percent of variance across the nuisance mask (CSF,
WM, combined, or temporal). The remaining components are dropped from
consideration.
The head-motion estimates calculated in the correction step were also
placed within the corresponding confounds file.
The confound time series derived from head motion estimates and global
signals were expanded with the inclusion of temporal derivatives and
quadratic terms for each [@confounds_satterthwaite_2013].
Frames that exceeded a threshold of 0.5 mm FD or
1.5 standardized DVARS were annotated as motion outliers.
Additional nuisance timeseries are calculated by means of principal components
analysis of the signal found within a thin band (*crown*) of voxels around
the edge of the brain, as proposed by [@patriat_improved_2017].
All resamplings can be performed with *a single interpolation
step* by composing all the pertinent transformations (i.e. head-motion
transform matrices, susceptibility distortion correction when available,
and co-registrations to anatomical and output spaces).
Gridded (volumetric) resamplings were performed using `nitransforms`,
configured with cubic B-spline interpolation.
